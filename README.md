# Web Studio - Responsive Design

Welcome to the final phase of the Web Studio project! During this stage, the adaptive layout has been successfully implemented for all homepage elements, guaranteeing a smooth appearance and functionality across various screen dimensions and devices. The following are the specifics of this project segment:

## Project Contents

### Responsive Design

- When browsing the website on any device with a width of 320px or more, the horizontal scrollbar does not appear, providing a smooth user experience.
- The script for the mobile menu is included in the HTML using a separate file named `mobile-menu.js`.

### Mobile Menu Script

- The mobile menu functionality is achieved using the script provided in the `mobile-menu.js` file.
- A comprehensive example of creating a mobile menu with the ready-made script can be found in the link provided.

### HTML Tags

- All pages within the `<head>` section have a meta tag for the viewport, ensuring proper scaling on different devices.
- All background images and content images are responsive and support both standard and high-density screens (x1 and x2).
- For responsive background images, the `min-device-pixel-ratio` and `min-resolution` media features are appropriately utilized.
- The markup for the mobile menu is completed using HTML tags.

### Styling

- A Mobile First approach is followed during the styling process, utilizing media features such as `min-width`.
- Styles are defined only within specific ranges, enclosed within media queries, using `min-width` and `max-width` conditions.
- There is no unnecessary duplication of styles within media queries.
- The layout is designed with consideration for three breakpoints: 480px, 768px, and 1200px.
- The styling for the mobile menu is finalized, providing an intuitive and visually appealing navigation experience on smaller screens.

## Conclusion

With the completion of the responsive layout for the homepage, the Web Studio project is now fully equipped to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience across a wide range of devices, from small smartphones to large desktop screens. The Mobile First approach ensures that the design is optimized for mobile devices, while media queries allow for targeted styling adjustments as the viewport width increases.
